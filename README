DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES ---------------------------

This module is just the base for all the tree. Follows some comments about how to
create an Oak Class.

. We are using the CPAN perlStyle, (almost) try to keep this.
. All objects in Oak are descendants of Oak::Object, so, read it's perldoc at first shot.
. Try to read the perldoc of all the superclasses of your class, it's very important
  when you override some methods.
. Nobody implements new, implement constructor instead, but nobody call constructor, call
  new instead.
. Error handling is made using Error module, check is perldoc to underestand what i'm
  talking about.
. That's it...
. Please contact me if you want to develop an Oak Object, if applicable your module will
  enter in the Oak main distribution.
